# AirBnB clone
**The AirBnB clone project is a group project at ALX, it is a continuos project  (i.e it is subdivided into steps). The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.**
## `The Console`

### 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help us to:
- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### Command interpreter?
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
